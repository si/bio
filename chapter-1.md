# Chapter 1
## Childhood

I never understand how other authors can so accurately reflect on their early years of childhood. 
Memories are only just forming yet they can easily recount such detail which amazes me. 
Maybe it's a weakness of mine that I shouldn't admit to, or maybe some authors are just filling in the blanks on some quite general thoughts.
We'll never know.
